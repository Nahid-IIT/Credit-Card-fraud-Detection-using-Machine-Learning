Credit card fraud is a significant problem, with billions of dollars lost each year. Machine learning can be used to detect credit card fraud by identifying patterns that are indicative of fraudulent transactions. Credit card fraud refers to the physical 
loss of a credit card or the loss of sensitive credit car information. Many machine- learning algorithms can be used for detection. This project proposes to develop a machine-learning model to detect credit card fraud. The model will be trained on a 
dataset of historical credit card transactions and evaluated on a holdout dataset of unseen transactions.

Keywords: Credit Card Fraud Detection, Fraud Detection, Fraudulent Transac- tions, K- Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision 
Tree.
